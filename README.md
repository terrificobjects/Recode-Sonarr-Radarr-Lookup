# Recode-Sonarr-Radarr-Lookup
This is a WordPress plugin used to experiment with remote downloading using a connection between WordPress and Sonarr/Radarr.

This is a work in progress- currently, this plugin needs LOTS of data sanitization and some middle-man software built in that can handle database requests and such.

With this plugin, you should be able to install and find settings for remote connection in Dashboard -> Media -> Recode Media Lookup. Make sure your Sonarr and Radarr ports are open and you can make a direct connection from WordPress to Sonarr.

Enjoy!
